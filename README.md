ðŸ§  Problem Statement:
Salifort Motors was facing high employee attrition, impacting organizational performance and HR stability. This project was developed to help the HR department:
â€¢	Understand key drivers of employee turnover.
â€¢	Forecast potential attrition risks.
â€¢	Make data-backed decisions to improve employee retention.

ðŸ“ˆ Project Workflow:
1. Data Collection & Preparation:
â€¢	Loaded HR datasets including employee satisfaction, evaluation, salary, and working hours.
â€¢	Cleaned data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
â€¢	Identified correlations and patterns using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
â€¢	Visual tools such as heatmaps, box plots, and histograms were used to understand attrition trends.
3. Modeling & Prediction:
â€¢	Built classification models using:
o	Logistic Regression
o	Decision Tree Classifier
â€¢	Model evaluation metrics included:
o	Accuracy
o	Precision
o	Recall
o	Confusion Matrix
4. Key Findings:
â€¢	Employees with low satisfaction levels and unbalanced working hours had higher attrition rates.
â€¢	Low salary tiers and limited career progression were also significant predictors.
â€¢	Decision tree revealed clear decision paths leading to attrition.

ðŸ“Š Visual Highlights:
â€¢	Attrition rates by satisfaction level
â€¢	Correlation heatmap of employee metrics
â€¢	Decision tree structure and feature importance
All visualizations are available within the Jupyter Notebook.

ðŸ“Œ Recommendations to HR:
â€¢	Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
â€¢	Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for atleast four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied. 
â€¢	Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so. 
â€¢	If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear. 
â€¢	Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts. 
â€¢	High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.

ðŸ”® Future Enhancements:
â€¢	Integrate model into a web dashboard using Flask + Power BI.
â€¢	Expand dataset with new KPIs like exit interview summaries.
â€¢	Deploy model to assist HR in real-time decision-making.
